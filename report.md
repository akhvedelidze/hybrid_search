Benin has implemented a **centralized border management system** (BBMS) to monitor cross-border movements, primarily focusing on southern borders. While the system captures biographic data through surveillance and border posts, explicit references to **biometric data collection** (e.g., fingerprinting or facial recognition) remain absent in available sources[2][4].  

### Key Components of the System  
1. **Benin Border Management System (BBMS)**  
   - Integrates terrestrial and maritime surveillance, initially targeting southern borders[2].  
   - Includes **coastal surveillance** (radar, AIS, CCTV) and **border surveillance** at hotspots like Krake and Hillacondji to combat smuggling[2].  
   - Operates through a **Joint Operations Control Center (JOCC)** to coordinate responses and manage sensor data[2].  

2. **Biographic Data Collection**  
   - The BBMS captures traveler biographic information via surveillance systems and border posts, but biometric modalities (e.g., fingerprinting) are not explicitly detailed[2][4].  

3. **Regional and International Collaboration**  
   - Participates in the **Integrated Border Stability Mechanism (IBSM)**, a UN-led initiative promoting cross-border data sharing and capacity building[3].  
   - The **Borders Academy** (launched in 2023 with French support) trains security forces in coordinated border management, emphasizing interoperability and intelligence sharing[4].  

### Legal and Policy Context  
- The **National Programme for Integrated Management of Border Spaces** (2007) mandates infrastructure development and cross-border cooperation[4].  
- The **Agency for Integrated Management of Border Spaces (ABeGIEF)** oversees implementation, prioritizing security and economic integration[4].  

### Limitations and Challenges  
- Security challenges in northern regions (e.g., VEO activity) limit system effectiveness, with VEO groups freely moving across Parks in Atacora and Alibori[1].  
- Explicit references to **biometric data capture** are absent in reviewed sources, suggesting potential gaps in traveler data collection[2][3][4].  

### Next Steps for Verification  
- Consult **ABeGIEF** for detailed technical specifications on data collection modalities[4].  
- Review IOM/UNODC reports on IBSM implementation for updates on biometric capabilities[3][5].  

This analysis synthesizes data from government initiatives, international partnerships, and security frameworks, with gaps noted in biometric specifics[1][2][3][4][5].
